# PIC K150 Programmer

Purchased many years ago. This was sold by a number of different companies apparently, with
many clones proliferating on ebay and other sites. Companies with links to information are
Future Electronics, kitsrsus.

This programmer supports older Microchip Industries 8-bit and 16-bit 
microcontrollers such as:

* PIC12C508
* PIC16C505
* PICF16F873

The full list of supported chips is listed in the manual linked below.

## Software

This programmer was originally supported under Windows Vista, but was often produced with imitation 
PL2303 chips that are not supported in recent versions of the Windows prolific driver.

The Windows programmer software is called DIYpack25.

Linux support may be available through a program called picpro.py circa 2004.

Linux detects my programmer as a PL2303.

There is a V1 and V2 of this board with minor differences.
